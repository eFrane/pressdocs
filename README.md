# Pressdocs

**WARNING**

**THIS IS A HIGHLY VOLATILE REPOSITORY AND SET OF NPM PACKAGES**

**DO NOT, AND I REALLY MEAN THIS, USE THIS ANYWHERE**

I hope to develop this into a opinionated but reasonably-easy configurable
set of packages to automate adding code documentation to VuePress instances.
However, at the moment this is me learning Lerna and wondering why everything
get's so much more complicated when dealing with package interdependencies.
