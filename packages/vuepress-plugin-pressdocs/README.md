# Pressdocs - A VuePress Plugin for Code Documentation

This [VuePress](https://vuepress.vuejs.org) Plugin will help you
to incorporate the documentation of your source code aka DocBlocks
into your VuePress-based documentation site.

## Language Providers

**On it's own, this plugin does not do anything.** You will have
to install and configure the language providers you need.

### Available Providers

Here's a list of the available providers:

| Provider | Supported Language(s) |
| -------- | --------------------- |
| `@pressdocs/lang-js` | JavaScript, TypeScript, anything else JsDoc supports |
